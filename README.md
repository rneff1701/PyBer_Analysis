## Summary and Recommendations
- Rural cities had both the highest average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver.
- Urban cities had both the highest number of rides and the highest number of drivers.
- Urban cities had more drivers (2,405) than riders (1,625).

- Look into increasing marketing in Rural cities to attract new customers.
- Urban drivers could be deployed to work in Suburban or Rural areas to balance the work force.
- Survey Suburban and Rural riders to get feedback and demographic information on riders.  
  - Are Urban riders younger?  
  - Are Rural riders older?  
  - Are Urban riders using the service for a night out?  
  - Are Rural riders using the service to run errands as they are unable to drive?
  - Where do Surburban riders fall on this spectrum?
